A curated list of awesome custom instructions for GitHub Copilot to enhance your coding experience.

[GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) is an AI pair programmer that helps you write better code. Custom instructions allow you to tailor Copilot's behavior to your specific needs and preferences.

## Why Custom Instructions?

Custom instructions allow you to enhance GitHub Copilot's responses by providing persistent context about your development preferences and requirements. These instructions automatically apply to all interactions with Copilot, eliminating the need to repeat context in every query. They can be configured for specific purposes:

1. **Code Generation**: Define coding style preferences, naming conventions, and implementation patterns
2. **Test Generation**: Specify testing frameworks and methodologies
3. **Code Review**: Set criteria and focus areas for code analysis
4. **Commit Messages**: Define commit message format and content requirements

Custom instructions are applied automatically in Chat view, Quick Chat, and Inline Chat, making them a powerful tool for maintaining consistency across your development workflow.

## How to Use

### Method 1: Using Settings
1. Open VS Code settings.json file
2. Configure custom instructions using `github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.instructions`
3. Instructions can be defined directly in settings or referenced from external files

Example settings.json configuration:
```json
"github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.instructions": [
  {
    "text": "Always add a comment: 'Generated by Copilot'."
  },
  {
    "text": "In TypeScript always use underscore for private field names."
  },
  {
    "file": "code-style.md"
  }
]
```

Example code-style.md:
```markdown
Always use React functional components.

Always add comments.
```

Note:
- Instructions can be defined at User or Workspace level
- You can specify language-specific instructions
- External files can be referenced using the `file` property
- Multiple instructions can be combined in a single configuration

### Method 2: Using Instructions File (Recommended)
1. Create a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file at the root of your workspace
```bash
mkdir -p .github
touch .github/copilot-instructions.md
```

2. Enable instruction files in VS Code settings:
   - Set `github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.useInstructionFiles` to `true`

3. Add your custom instructions to the file using Markdown format

Note:
- Instructions can be written as single paragraphs or separated by blank lines
- Whitespace between instructions is ignored
- The file works in both VS Code and Visual Studio
- If you have instructions in both settings and the file, Copilot will combine them

**Tip**: In VS Code's Explorer view, you can create the folder and file in one step by typing the full path as the file name.
